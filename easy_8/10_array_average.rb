# Write a method that takes one argument, an array containing integers,
# and returns the average of all numbers in the array.
# The array will never be empty and the numbers will always be positive integers.
# Your result should also be an integer.

# Don't use the Array#sum method for your solution - see if you can solve this problem using iteration more directly.

# Examples:
# puts average([1, 6]) == 3 # integer division: (1 + 6) / 2 -> 3
# puts average([1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8]) == 25
# puts average([9, 47, 23, 95, 16, 52]) == 40

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,
