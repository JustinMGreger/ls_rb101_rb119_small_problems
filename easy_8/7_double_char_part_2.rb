# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes a string,
# and returns a new string in which every consonant character is doubled.
# Vowels (a,e,i,o,u), digits, punctuation, and whitespace should not be doubled.

# Examples:
# p double_consonants('String') == 'SSttrrinngg'
# p double_consonants('Hello-World!') == 'HHellllo-WWorrlldd!'
# p double_consonants('July 4th') == 'JJullyy 4tthh'
# p double_consonants('') == ''

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# a string

# output:
# a new string in which every consonant character is doubled.

Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Mental model of the problem (optional):

#Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# p double_consonants('String') == 'SSttrrinngg'
# p double_consonants('Hello-World!') == 'HHellllo-WWorrlldd!'
# p double_consonants('July 4th') == 'JJullyy 4tthh'
# p double_consonants('') == ''

Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
and Code. Implementation of Algorithm:

# tests:
p double_consonants('String') == 'SSttrrinngg'
p double_consonants('Hello-World!') == 'HHellllo-WWorrlldd!'
p double_consonants('July 4th') == 'JJullyy 4tthh'
p double_consonants('') == ''
