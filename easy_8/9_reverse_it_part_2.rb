# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes one argument,
# a string containing one or more words,
# and returns the given string with words that contain five or more characters reversed.
# Each string will consist of only letters and spaces.
# Spaces should be included only when more than one word is present.

# Examples:
# puts reverse_words('Professional')          # => lanoisseforP
# puts reverse_words('Walk around the block') # => Walk dnuora the kcolb
# puts reverse_words('Launch School')         # => hcnuaL loohcS

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# a string argument containing one or more words.

# output:
# the given string with words that contain five or more characters reversed.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Write a method that takes one argument.
# the argument is a string containing one or more words.
# return the given string with words that contain five or more characters reversed.
# Each string will consist of only letters and spaces.
# Spaces should be included only when more than one word is present.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# def reverse_words(string)
return the given string with words that contain five or more characters reversed.
Each string will consist of only letters and spaces.
Spaces should be included only when more than one word is present.





# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# puts reverse_words('Professional')          # => lanoisseforP
# puts reverse_words('Walk around the block') # => Walk dnuora the kcolb
# puts reverse_words('Launch School')         # => hcnuaL loohcS

Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
and Code. Implementation of Algorithm:

# tests:
puts reverse_words('Professional')          # => lanoisseforP
puts reverse_words('Walk around the block') # => Walk dnuora the kcolb
puts reverse_words('Launch School')         # => hcnuaL loohcS
