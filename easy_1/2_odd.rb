Descrsiption of Exercise:
Write a method that takes one integer argument, which may be positive, negative, or zero. 
This method returns true if the number's absolute value is odd. 
You may assume that the argument is a valid integer value.

Examples:
puts is_odd?(2)    # => false
puts is_odd?(5)    # => true
puts is_odd?(-17)  # => true
puts is_odd?(-8)   # => false
puts is_odd?(0)    # => false
puts is_odd?(7)    # => true

Description of Exercise:
Keep in mind that you're not allowed to use #odd? or #even? in your solution.

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
 Identify expected input and output
 Make the requirements explicit
 Identify rules
 Mental model of the problem (optional)

Examples / Test Cases, 
 Validate understanding of the problem

Data Structure, 
 How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.

Algorithm, 
 Steps for converting input to output

and Code.” 
 Implementation of Algorithm
