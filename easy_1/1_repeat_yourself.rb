Description of Exercise:
Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, and prints the string as many times as the 
integer indicates.

Example:
repeat('Hello', 3)

Output:
Hello
Hello
Hello

PEDAC stands for â€œ[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input:
Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer
 
and output:
print the string as many times as the integer indicates.
 
Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, and prints the string as many times as the 
integer indicates.

Mental model of the problem (optional):

Example:
repeat('Hello', 3)
Output:
Hello
Hello
Hello

Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, and prints the string as many times as the 
integer indicates.

syntax:
repeat('Hello', 3)

explanation:
repeat is a method.
('Hello', 3) are arguments that is a string and a integer.
this means:
repeat calls the repeat method that accepts the ('Hello', 3) arguments where 'Hello' is a string and 3 is a integer.
the syntax is similar to:
def repeat(string, integer)

Syntax:
Hello
Hello
Hello

Explanation:
Hello is a string that has been printed to the screen 3 times.
Hello is a string.
printed to the screen is puts.
3 is a integer.
times is the .times method.
which would be:
puts string integer.times
the syntax is similar to:
integer.times do
  puts string
end

combining both:
def repeat(string, integer)
integer.times do
  puts string
end

refactoring it:
def repeat(string, integer)
  integer.times do
    puts string
  end
end

refactored with the original example as a call:
def repeat(string, integer)
  integer.times do
    puts string
  end
end

repeat('Hello', 3)

the output of which is:
Hello
Hello
Hello
