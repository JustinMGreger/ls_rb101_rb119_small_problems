Write a method that takes a non-empty string argument, 
and returns the middle character or characters of the argument. 
If the argument has an odd length, you should return exactly one character. 
If the argument has an even length, you should return exactly two characters.

Examples:

center_of('I love ruby') == 'e'
center_of('Launch School') == ' '
center_of('Launch') == 'un'
center_of('Launchschool') == 'hs'
center_of('x') == 'x'

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
a non-empty string argument

and output:
return the middle character or characters of the argument. 
If the argument has an odd length, you should return exactly one character. 
If the argument has an even length, you should return exactly two characters.

Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Write a method that takes a non-empty string argument, and returns the middle character or characters of the argument. 
If the argument has an odd length, you should return exactly one character. 
If the argument has an even length, you should return exactly two characters.
