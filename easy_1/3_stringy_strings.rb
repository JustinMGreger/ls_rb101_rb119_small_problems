Description of Exercise:
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns a string of alternating 1s and 0s, 
always starting with 1. The length of the string should match the given integer.

Examples:
puts stringy(6) == '101010'
puts stringy(9) == '101010101'
puts stringy(4) == '1010'
puts stringy(7) == '1010101'

Description of Exercise:
The tests above should print true.

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer.

and output:
return a string of alternating 1s and 0s, always starting with 1.
The length of the string should match the given integer.
Examples:
puts stringy(6) == '101010'
puts stringy(9) == '101010101'
puts stringy(4) == '1010'
puts stringy(7) == '1010101'
The tests above should print true.

Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns a string of alternating 1s and 0s, 
always starting with 1. 
The length of the string should match the given integer.
Examples:
