Description of Exercise:
Write a method that will take a short line of text, and print it within a box.

Example:
print_in_box('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')
+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |
| To boldly go where no one has gone before. |
|                                            |
+--------------------------------------------+
print_in_box('')
+--+
|  |
|  |
|  |
+--+
You may assume that the input will always fit in your terminal window.


PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
a short line of text

and output:
print a short line of text within a box.

Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Write a method that will take a short line of text, and print it within a box.
Example:
print_in_box('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')
+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |

You may assume that the input will always fit in your terminal window.

Mental model of the problem (optional):
Write a method that will take a short line of text, and print it within a box.
Example:
print_in_box('To boldly go where no one has gone before.')
