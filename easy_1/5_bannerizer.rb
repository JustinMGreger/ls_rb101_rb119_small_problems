PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
a short line of text

and output:

Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:

Mental model of the problem (optional):

Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:

Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:

Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:

and Code.” Implementation of Algorithm:
