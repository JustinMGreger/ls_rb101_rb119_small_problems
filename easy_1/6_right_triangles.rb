Description of Exercise:
Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n 
stars. 
The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the 
triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

Examples:
triangle(5)

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: a positive integer, n, as an argument

and output: displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in
the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:

Mental model of the problem (optional):
Description of Exercise:
Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n 
stars. 
The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the 
triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

Examples:
triangle(5)     this is the method name.

    *            1 stars  * is 5 spaces to the right.
   **            2 stars  * is 5 spaces to the right. * is 4 spaces to the right.
  ***            3 stars  * is 5 spaces to the right. * is 4 spaces to the right. * is 3 spaces to the right.
 ****            4 stars  * is 5 spaces to the right. * is 4 spaces to the right. * is 3 spaces to the right. * is 2 spaces to the right. 
*****            5 stars  * is 5 spaces to the right. * is 4 spaces to the right. * is 3 spaces to the right. * is 2 spaces to the right. * is 1 space to the right.

Syntax so far:
def triangle(n)
  n is the number of lines
  n is the number of * printed.
end
somehow the first * is n spaces to the right this mean it is r justified.
