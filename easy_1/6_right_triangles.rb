Description of Exercise:
Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a right triangle whose sides each have n 
stars. 
The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the 
triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: a positive integer, n, as an argument

and output: displays a right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle (the diagonal side in
the images below) should have one end at the lower-left of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.
