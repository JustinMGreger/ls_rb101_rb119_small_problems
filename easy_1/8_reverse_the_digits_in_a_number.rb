Write a method that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns that number with its digits reversed.

Examples:
reversed_number(12345) == 54321
reversed_number(12213) == 31221
reversed_number(456) == 654
reversed_number(12000) == 21 # No leading zeros in return value!
reversed_number(12003) == 30021
reversed_number(1) == 1


Don't worry about arguments with leading zeros - Ruby sees those as octal numbers, which will cause confusing results. 
For similar reasons, the return value for our fourth example doesn't have any leading zeros.


PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
reversed_number(12345)
and output:
54321
