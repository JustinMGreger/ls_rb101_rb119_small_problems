Description of Exercise:
Write a method that takes two arguments, a positive integer and a boolean, and calculates the bonus for a given salary. 
If the boolean is true, the bonus should be half of the salary. If the boolean is false, the bonus should be 0.

Examples:
puts calculate_bonus(2800, true) == 1400
puts calculate_bonus(1000, false) == 0
puts calculate_bonus(50000, true) == 25000

The tests above should print true.

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
two arguments, a positive integer and a boolean.

and output:
calculates the bonus for a given salary if the boolean is true, the bonus should be half of the salary. 
If the boolean is false, the bonus should be 0.
tests:
puts calculate_bonus(2800, true) == 1400
puts calculate_bonus(1000, false) == 0
puts calculate_bonus(50000, true) == 25000
The tests above should print true.
