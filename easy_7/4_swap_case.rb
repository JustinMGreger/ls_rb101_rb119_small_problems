# Swap Case

# Write a method that takes a string as an argument
# and returns a new string in which every uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version,
# and every lowercase letter by its uppercase version.
# All other characters should be unchanged.

# You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.

# Example:
p swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
p swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'
