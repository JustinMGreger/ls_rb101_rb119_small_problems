# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments,
# and returns a new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments,
# with the elements taken in alternation.

# You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty,
# and that they have the same number of elements.

# Example:
interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem,
