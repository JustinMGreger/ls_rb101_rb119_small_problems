# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that returns the next to last word in the String passed to it as an argument.

# Words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

# You may assume that the input String will always contain at least two words.

# Examples:
p penultimate('last word') == 'last'
p penultimate('Launch School is great!') == 'is'

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# a string parameter that will always contain at least two words which are any sequence of non-blank characters.

# output:
# the next to last word in the string parameter where words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Write a penultimate method.
# the penultimate method returns the next to last word in the string parameter.
# the string parameter will always contain at least two words and words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

Mental model of the problem (optional):
# def penultimate method(string)
# the penultimate method returns the next to last word in the string parameter.
# the string parameter will always contain at least two words and words are any sequence of non-blank characters.





# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
p penultimate('last word') == 'last'
p penultimate('Launch School is great!') == 'is'
