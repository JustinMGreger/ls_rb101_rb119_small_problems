# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that counts the number of occurrences of each element in a given array.

# vehicles = [
#   'car', 'car', 'truck', 'car', 'SUV', 'truck',
#   'motorcycle', 'motorcycle', 'car', 'truck'
# ]

# count_occurrences(vehicles)

# The words in the array are case-sensitive: 'suv' != 'SUV'.
# Once counted, print each element alongside the number of occurrences.

# Expected output:
# car => 4
# truck => 3
# SUV => 1
# motorcycle => 2

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem,
