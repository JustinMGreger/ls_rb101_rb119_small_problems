# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes a String as an argument,
# and returns a new String that contains the original value
# using a staggered capitalization scheme in which every other character is capitalized,
# and the remaining characters are lowercase.
# Characters that are not letters should not be changed,
# but count as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.

# Example:
staggered_case('I Love Launch School!') == 'I LoVe lAuNcH ScHoOl!'
staggered_case('ALL_CAPS') == 'AlL_CaPs'
staggered_case('ignore 77 the 444 numbers') == 'IgNoRe 77 ThE 444 NuMbErS'
