# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes two Array arguments in which each Array contains a list of numbers,
# and returns a new Array
# that contains the product of each pair of numbers from the arguments that have the same index.
# You may assume that the arguments contain the same number of elements.

# Examples:

p multiply_list([3, 5, 7], [9, 10, 11]) == [27, 50, 77]

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem,
Identify expected input:
output:
Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Mental model of the problem (optional):
Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
and Code.” Implementation of Algorithm:
