# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes an Array, and returns a new Array with the elements of the original list in reverse order.
# Do not modify the original list.

# You may not use Array#reverse or Array#reverse!, nor may you use the method you wrote in the previous exercise.

# Examples:
p reverse([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [4, 3, 2, 1] # => true
p reverse(%w[a b e d c]) == %w[c d e b a]  # => true
p reverse(['abc']) == ['abc']              # => true
p reverse([]) == []                        # => true

p list = [1, 3, 2]                      # => [1, 3, 2]
p new_list = reverse(list)              # => [2, 3, 1]
p list.object_id != new_list.object_id  # => true
p list == [1, 3, 2]                     # => true
p new_list == [2, 3, 1]                 # => true
