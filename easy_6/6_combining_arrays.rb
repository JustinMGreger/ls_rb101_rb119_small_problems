# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes two Arrays as arguments,
# and returns an Array that contains all of the values from the argument Arrays.
# There should be no duplication of values in the returned Array,
# even if there are duplicates in the original Arrays.

# Example
p merge([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 

# Identify expected input: 
# two Arrays as arguments
