Write a program that prompts the user for two positive integers, 
and then prints the results of the following operations on those two numbers: 
addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, and power. 
Do not worry about validating the input.



def prompt(message) 
  puts message
end


Example
prompt ==> Enter the first number:
first_number = 23
prompt ==> Enter the second number:
17
prompt ==> 23 + 17 = 40
prompt ==> 23 - 17 = 6
prompt ==> 23 * 17 = 391
prompt ==> 23 / 17 = 1
prompt ==> 23 % 17 = 6
prompt ==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103
