# You have a bank of switches before you, numbered from 1 to n.
# Each switch is connected to exactly one light that is initially off.
# You walk down the row of switches and toggle every one of them.

# You repeat this process and keep going until you have been through n repetitions.

# Write a method that takes one argument, the total number of switches, and returns an Array
# that identifies which lights are on after n repetitions.

# Example with n = 5 lights:
