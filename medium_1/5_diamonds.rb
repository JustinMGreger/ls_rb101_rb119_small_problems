# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that displays a 4-pointed diamond in an n x n grid,
# where n is an odd integer that is supplied as an argument to the method.
# You may assume that the argument will always be an odd integer.

# Examples:
# diamond(1)

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# the n odd integer.

# output:
# a 4-pointed diamond in an n x n grid.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Write a method that displays a 4-pointed diamond in an n x n grid,
# where n is an odd integer that is supplied as an argument to the method.
# You may assume that the argument will always be an odd integer.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# n will always be an odd integer.
# def diamond(n)
# displays a 4-pointed diamond in an n x n grid,
# where n is an odd integer that is supplied as an argument to the method.

# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# diamond(1)
# diamond(3)
# diamond(9)
