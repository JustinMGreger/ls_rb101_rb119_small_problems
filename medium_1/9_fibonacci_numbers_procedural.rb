Ruby does a reasonably good job of handling recursion, but it isn't designed for heavy recursion; as a result, the Fibonacci solution is only useful up to about fibonacci(40). With higher values of nth, the recursive solution is impractical. (Our tail recursive solution did much better, but even that failed at around fibonacci(8200).)

Fortunately, every recursive method can be rewritten as a non-recursive (procedural) method.

Rewrite your recursive fibonacci method so that it computes its results without recursion.

Examples:
