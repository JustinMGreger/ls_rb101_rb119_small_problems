# frozen_string_literal: true

# In the easy exercises,
# we worked on a problem where we had to count the number of uppercase and lowercase characters,
# as well as characters that were neither of those two.
# Now we want to go one step further.

# Write a method that takes a string,
# and then returns a hash that contains 3 entries:
# one represents the percentage of characters in the string that are lowercase letters,
# one the percentage of characters that are uppercase letters,
# and one the percentage of characters that are neither.

# You may assume that the string will always contain at least one character.
