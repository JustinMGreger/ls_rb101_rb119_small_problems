# frozen_string_literal: true

# A triangle is classified as follows:

# equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
# isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
# scalene All 3 sides are of different length
# To be a valid triangle,
# the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side,
# and all sides must have lengths greater than 0:
# if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments,
# and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene,
or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.
