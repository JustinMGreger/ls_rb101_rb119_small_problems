Description of Exercise:
Use irb to run the following code:

Initial Given Syntax:
a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min

Explanation of Initial Given Syntax:

Syntax:
a = [5, 9, 3, 11]

Explanation:
a is a variable.
= means assignment.
[5, 9, 3, 11] is a array of integers.

Syntax:
puts a.min

Explanation:
puts means put s which is put string which is print to the screen the string.
a is a variable.
= means assignment.
[5, 9, 3, 11] is a array of integers.
.min method returns the minimum value.
this means:
print to the screen the variable a which is assigned the [5, 9, 3, 11] array of integers that calls the .min method which 
returns the minimum value.
the output of which is:
3

Description of Exercise:
Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print the two smallest values in the Array.

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).

PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
 Identify expected input and output
 Make the requirements explicit
 Identify rules
 Mental model of the problem (optional)

Examples / Test Cases, 
 Validate understanding of the problem

Data Structure, 
 How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output.

Algorithm, 
 Steps for converting input to output

and Code.” 
 Implementation of Algorithm
