# frozen_string_literal: true

# Given a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters,
# write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces.
# If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row,
# you should only have one space in the result (the result should never have consecutive spaces).

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# input: a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters
# write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. 
# the result should never have consecutive spaces
# output: return a string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces.

# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
p cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '

# Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
# Array.
