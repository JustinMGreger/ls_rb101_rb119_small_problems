# frozen_string_literal: true

# Given a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters,
# write a method that returns that string with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces.
# If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row,
# you should only have one space in the result (the result should never have consecutive spaces).

# Examples:
cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '

# Identify expected input: 
# a string that consists of some words (all lowercased) and an assortment of non-alphabetic characters
