# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns a list of the digits in the number.

# Examples:
p puts digit_list(12345) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     # => true
p puts digit_list(7) == [7]                     # => true
p puts digit_list(375290) == [3, 7, 5, 2, 9, 0] # => true
p puts digit_list(444) == [4, 4, 4]             # => true

PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 
Identify expected input: 
output:
Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Mental model of the problem (optional):
Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
and Code.” Implementation of Algorithm:
