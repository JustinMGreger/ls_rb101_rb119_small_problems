# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words and returns a hash that shows the number
# of words of different sizes.

# Words consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.

Mental model of the problem (optional):
Words = consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.
Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words
and returns a hash that shows the number of words of different sizes.
Hash is a data Structure of keys & values.
def word_sizes(string)
  key = word lengths
  value = how many words are that length
  hash = {key: value, key:value}
end
