# frozen_string_literal: true
# Given a string of words separated by spaces,
# write a method that takes this string of words and returns a string in which the first and last letters of
# every word are swapped.

# You may assume that every word contains at least one letter,
# and that the string will always contain at least one word.
# You may also assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# def swap (a string that will always contain nothing but at least one word where every word contains at least one letter
# and each word is separated by spaces)
#   returns a string in which the first and last letters of every word are swapped.
# end

# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
p swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is') == 'hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si'
p swap('Abcde') == 'ebcdA'
p swap('a') == 'a'

# Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
# 1. the swap method accepts a string.
# 2. assigned the result of: swapping the first and last letters of every word
# 3. return this swapped string.
