# frozen_string_literal: true
# Given a string of words separated by spaces,
# write a method that takes this string of words and returns a string in which the first and last letters of
# every word are swapped.

# You may assume that every word contains at least one letter,
# and that the string will always contain at least one word.
# You may also assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces.

# Examples:
swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is') == 'hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si'
swap('Abcde') == 'ebcdA'
swap('a') == 'a'

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# write a method that takes:
# a string of words where every word contains at least one letter,
# that the string will always contain at least one word,
# each string contains nothing but words and spaces, 
# separated by spaces 
# and returns a string in which the first and last letters of every word are swapped.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# def swap (a string that will always contain nothing but at least one word where every word contains at least one letter
# and each word is separated by spaces)
#   returns a string in which the first and last letters of every word are swapped.
# end
