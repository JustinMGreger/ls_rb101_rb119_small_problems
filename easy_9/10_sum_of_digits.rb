# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of its digits.

# Examples:
puts sum(23) == 5
puts sum(496) == 19
puts sum(123_456_789) == 45

# The tests above should print true.

# For a challenge, try writing this without any basic looping constructs (while, until, loop, and each).

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,
