# frozen_string_literal: true

# Given the array...
# words = %w[demo none tied evil dome mode live fowl veil wolf diet vile edit tide flow neon]

# Write a program that prints out groups of words that are anagrams.
# Anagrams are words that have the same exact letters in them but in a different order.
# Your output should look something like this:
# %w[demo dome mode]
# %w[neon none]
# (etc)

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# words = %w[demo none tied evil dome mode live fowl veil wolf diet vile edit tide flow neon]

# output:
# groups of words that are anagrams.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Write a program that prints out groups of words that are anagrams.
# Anagrams are words that have the same exact letters in them but in a different order.
