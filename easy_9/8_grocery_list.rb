# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method which takes a grocery list (array) of fruits with quantities
# and converts it into an array of the correct number of each fruit.

# Example:
# p buy_fruit([['apples', 3], ['orange', 1], ['bananas', 2]]) ==
# %w[apples apples apples orange bananas bananas]

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# a grocery list (array) of fruits with quantities.

# output:
# an array of the correct number of each fruit.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Write a method which takes a grocery list (array) of fruits with quantities
# and converts it into an array of the correct number of each fruit.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# def buy_fruit(grocery_list)

and converts it into an array of the correct number of each fruit.



# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# p buy_fruit([['apples', 3], ['orange', 1], ['bananas', 2]]) ==
# %w[apples apples apples orange bananas bananas]
