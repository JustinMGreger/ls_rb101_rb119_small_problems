# frozen_string_literal: true

# Write a method that takes a first name, a space, and a last name passed as a single String argument,
# and returns a string that contains the last name, a comma, a space, and the first name.

# Examples
# p swap_name('Joe Roberts') == 'Roberts, Joe'

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# first name, a space, and a last name passed as a single String argument.

# output:
# a string that contains the last name, a comma, a space, and the first name.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Write a method that takes a first name, a space, and a last name passed as a single String argument,
# and returns a string that contains the last name, a comma, a space, and the first name.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# def swap_name(first name, a space, and a last name passed as a single String argument)
and returns a string that contains the last name, a comma, a space, and the first name.




# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# p swap_name('Joe Roberts') == 'Roberts, Joe'
