# Write a method that takes a first name, a space, and a last name passed as a single String argument,
# and returns a string that contains the last name, a comma, a space, and the first name.

# Examples
# p swap_name('Joe Roberts') == 'Roberts, Joe'

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

Identify expected input:
output:
Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
Mental model of the problem (optional):

# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# p swap_name('Joe Roberts') == 'Roberts, Joe'

Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
and Code. Implementation of Algorithm:

# tests:
p swap_name('Joe Roberts') == 'Roberts, Joe'
