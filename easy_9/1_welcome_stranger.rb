# frozen_string_literal: true

# Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash.
# The array will contain 2 or more elements that,
# when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name.
# The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation, and the appropriate values.
# Your method should return a greeting that uses the person's full name,
# and mentions the person's title and occupation.

# Example:
p greetings(['John', 'Q', 'Doe'], { title: 'Master', occupation: 'Plumber' })
# => "Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around."

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for [Understand the] Problem,

# Identify expected input:
# 2 arguments, an array and a hash. 
# The array will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name.
# The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation, and the appropriate values. 

# output:
# a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title and occupation.

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash.
# The array will contain 2 or more elements that,
# when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name.
# The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation, and the appropriate values.
# Your method should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title and occupation.

# Mental model of the problem (optional):
Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash.
