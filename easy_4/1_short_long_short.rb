# Write a method that takes two strings as arguments, determines the longest of the two strings, and then returns the 
# result of concatenating the shorter string, the longer string, and the shorter string once again. 
# You may assume that the strings are of different lengths.

# Tests:
short_long_short('abc', 'defgh') == "abcdefghabc"
short_long_short('abcde', 'fgh') == "fghabcdefgh"
short_long_short('', 'xyz') == "xyz"

# PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
# PEDAC stands for “[Understand the] Problem, 

# Identify expected input: 
# two strings

# and output:
# returns the result of concatenating the shorter string, the longer string, and the shorter string once again. 

# Make the requirements explicit Identify rules:
# Mental model of the problem (optional):
# Examples / Test Cases, Validate understanding of the problem:
# Data Structure, How we represent data that we will work with when converting the input to output:
# Algorithm, Steps for converting input to output:
# and Code.” Implementation of Algorithm:
