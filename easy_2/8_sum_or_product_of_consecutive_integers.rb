Try to use #inject in your solution to this problem.

def prompt(message)  
  puts message
end

def sum
#inject
end



prompt '>> Please enter an integer greater than 0:'
input = 5
if input is <= 0 then prompt 'error' and go back to asking the question in a loop until it is correct.

prompt ">> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product."
if
input = s
prompt "The sum of the integers between 1 and #{5} is #{15}."
elsif
input = p
prompt "The product of the integers between 1 and #{6} is #{720}."
else
if input is != s or p then prompt 'error' and go back to asking the question in a loop until it is correct.
