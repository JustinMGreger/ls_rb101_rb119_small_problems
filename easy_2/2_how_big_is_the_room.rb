Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters 
and then displays the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.

Note: 1 square meter == 10.7639 square feet

Do not worry about validating the input at this time.

def room_size
puts "Enter the length of the room in meters: "
length = 10
puts "Enter the width of the room in meters: "
7
puts "The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet)."
